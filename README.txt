# RandomForestStockPrediction

A Python project to predict stock price movements using a Random Forest algorithm. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze historical stock trading data and forecast future trends.

## Notes
- This project is a WORK IN PROGRESS.
- The project is intended to be used as an introduction to machine learning and stock prediction.
- I intend to add more features and improve the project over time.

## Features
- Implements Random Forest for stock prediction.
- Analyzes key stock trading metrics such as close, open, and high prices.
- Includes preprocessing steps for cleaning and organizing trading data.
